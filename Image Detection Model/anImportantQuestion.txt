imagine...

you scan a plastic toy alligator
model recognizes it as {"id": 5,"name": "alligator/gator"}

do you treat it:
a) like a toy; or
b) like an actual alligator, on the off-chance that someone scanned an actual live prolly-trying-to-bite-you gator

follow up question:
is it fragile or food?
